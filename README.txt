Objectives

In this project you will use some of your old functions made in your old repository. You will use them with the objective of making a simple text completion/editing/auto-correction tool.

One more detail. This time the project will be corrected by auditors. The auditors will be other students and you will be an auditor as well.

We advise you to create your own tests for yourself and for when you will correct your auditees.
